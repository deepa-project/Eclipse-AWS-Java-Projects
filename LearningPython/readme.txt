I have used the book "Python for Kids" by Jason R.Briggs to
learn Pythin as quickly as possible so that I may be able to do my web scraping 
project -without knowing the syntax it is going to get very difficult
as web scraping is complicated as one needs to view the page source and get the
token words!

I need to be able to differentiate between Python sytanx and web scraping syntaz
as I work out examples using web scraping python packages such as beautifulSoup and
Selenium!!
Thank you
